Q.1. Create a transactional ORC table "ﬁre_data" with appropriate data types partitioned by city and buckted by call number into 4 buckets. Load data from
staging table into this table.

 Step 1: Enable Bucketing and Transactions (if not already)


SET hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;
SET hive.txn.manager = org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager;
SET hive.compactor.initiator.on = true;
SET hive.compactor.worker.threads = 1;



Step 2: Create the staging table (if not created already)


CREATE TABLE staging_fire_data (
  call_number INT,
  unit_id STRING,
  incident_number STRING,
  call_type STRING,
  call_date DATE,
  watch_date DATE,
  received_timestamp STRING,
  entry_timestamp STRING,
  response_timestamp STRING,
  neighborhood STRING,
  city STRING,
  zip_code INT,
  battalion STRING,
  station_area STRING,
  box STRING,
  primary_unit STRING,
  location STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


Step 3: Create the transactional ORC table fire_data



CREATE TABLE fire_data (
  call_number INT,
  unit_id STRING,
  incident_number STRING,
  call_type STRING,
  call_date DATE,
  watch_date DATE,
  received_timestamp STRING,
  entry_timestamp STRING,
  response_timestamp STRING,
  neighborhood STRING,
  zip_code INT,
  battalion STRING,
  station_area STRING,
  box STRING,
  primary_unit STRING,
  location STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (city STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (call_number) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'transactional' = 'true'
);



 Step 4: Load data from staging into fire_data


INSERT INTO TABLE fire_data
PARTITION (city)
SELECT
  call_number,
  unit_id,
  incident_number,
  call_type,
  call_date,
  watch_date,
  received_timestamp,
  entry_timestamp,
  response_timestamp,
  neighborhood,
  zip_code,
  battalion,
  station_area,
  box,
  primary_unit,
  location,
  city
FROM staging_fire_data;





Q.2. Execute following queries on ﬁre dataset.


1. How many distinct types of calls were made to the ﬁre department?
Ans:


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT call_type) AS distinct_call_types
FROM fire_data;


+----------------------+
| distinct_call_types  |
+----------------------+
| 0                    |
+----------------------+



2. What are distinct types of calls made to the ﬁre department?
Ans:

SELECT DISTINCT call_type
FROM fire_data
WHERE call_type IS NOT NULL;

+------------+
| call_type  |
+------------+
+------------+


3. Find out all responses for delayed times greater than 5 mins?

SELECT *
FROM fire_data
WHERE 
  unix_timestamp(response_timestamp, 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss') - unix_timestamp(received_timestamp, 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss') > 300;

No rows selected (0.277 seconds)





4. What were the most common call types?
Ans:


SELECT call_type, COUNT(*) AS total_calls
FROM fire_data
WHERE call_type IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY call_type
ORDER BY total_calls DESC
LIMIT 5;
